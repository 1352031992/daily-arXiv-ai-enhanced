Motivated by the SymTFT construction of arXiv:2409.02806, we provide a general formula for SREE that applies to symmetric (weakly/strongly) and cloaking boundary conditions as well as for fusion rings with multiplicities. We check the formula against several explicit examples. Additionally, we study symmetry resolution for both categorical and invertible symmetries in (non-)diagonal RCFTs and comment on the subtleties that arise in these cases. Finally, we extend our analysis to diagonal non-unitary RCFTs, focusing on theories with generalized Haagerup-Izumi modular data, and find full agreement with the given formula."}

We first classify one-dimensional representations of $A_q$, on which spin-j K-operators constructed in [LBG] act as K-matrices. Using the K-operators and these K-matrices, we construct universal spin-j transfer matrices generating commutative subalgebras in $A_q$. Within a technical conjecture, we derive their fusion hierarchy, the so-called universal TT-relations. On spin-chain representations of $A_q$, we show how the universal transfer matrices evaluate to spin-chain transfer matrices, and as a result we get explicit TT-relations for all values of spins for auxiliary and quantum spaces, any inhomogeneities, and general integrable boundary conditions. In particular, we derive previously conjectured TT-relations. Using the TT-relations, we show that n-th local conserved quantities of the spin-j chains of length N are polynomials of total degree 4Njn in two non-local operators of the q-Onsager algebra. As a result, we give an algorithm of explicit calculation of all conserved quantities (Hamiltonians and higher logarithmic derivatives of the transfer matrix) in terms of spin operators. Furthermore, using the universal TT-relations we derive exchange relations between spin-j Hamiltonians and the two non-local operators, which shows existence of non-trivial symmetries for special boundary conditions, in the sense that they commute with all Hamiltonian densities. As a yet another application of our universal TT-relations we propose universal T-system, Y-system and universal TQ-relations for $A_q$, and as a result, universal TQ for the q-Onsager algebra. In view of application to diagonal boundary conditions, we also obtain universal TT- and TQ-relations for a certain degenerate version of $A_q$ known as centrally extended augmented q-Onsager algebra."}

These can be viewed as a far-reaching generalisation of rotational tangle diagrams for (virtual) upwards tangles, and constitute the topological analogue of XC-algebras, the minimum algebraic structure needed to construct an knot isotopy invariant following the construction of Lawrence and Lee. XC-tangles admit a very natural description in terms of the so-called XC-Gauss diagrams, and this equivalence lifts the well-known equivalence between virtual upwards tangles and upwards Gauss diagrams. For every XC-algebra $A$, there is a naturally defined strict monoidal full functor $Z_A: \\mathcal{T}^{\\mathrm{XC}} \\rightarrow v\\mathcal{E}(A)$ from the category of XC-tangles to the \"virtual category of elements of $A$\". When $A$ is the endomorphism algebra of a finite-dimensional representation of a ribbon Hopf algebra, this functor can be viewed as an extension of the corresponding Reshetikhin-Turaev functor. Lastly, we also initiate the study of a theory of finite type invariants for one-component XC-tangles that lifts that for virtual long knots."}

Final version to appear in Communications in Mathematical Physics", "summary": "This paper presents a conceptual and efficient geometric framework to encode the algebraic structures on the category of superselection sectors of an algebraic quantum field theory on the $n$-dimensional lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^n$. It is shown that, under the typical assumption of Haag duality, the monoidal $C^\\ast$-categories of localized superselection sectors carry the structure of a locally constant prefactorization algebra over the category of cone-shaped subsets of $\\mathbb{Z}^n$. Employing techniques from higher algebra, one extracts from this datum an underlying locally constant prefactorization algebra defined on open disks in the cylinder $\\mathbb{R}^1\\times\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$. While the sphere $\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ arises geometrically as the angular coordinates of cones, the origin of the line $\\mathbb{R}^1$ is analytic and rooted in Haag duality. The usual braided (for $n=2$) or symmetric (for $n\\geq 3$) monoidal $C^\\ast$-categories of superselection sectors are recovered by removing a point of the sphere $\\mathbb{R}^1\\times(\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}\\setminus\\mathrm{pt}) \\cong\\mathbb{R}^n$ and using the equivalence between $\\mathbb{E}_n$-algebras and locally constant prefactorization algebras defined on open disks in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The non-trivial homotopy groups of spheres induce additional algebraic structures on these $\\mathbb{E}_n$-monoidal $C^\\ast$-categories, which in the case of $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ is given by a braided monoidal self-equivalence arising geometrically as a kind of `holonomy' around the circle $\\mathbb{S}^1$. The locally constant prefactorization algebra structures discovered in this work generalize, under some mild geometric conditions, to other discrete spaces and thereby provide a clear link between the geometry of the localization regions and the algebraic structures on the category of superselection sectors."}

Our notion of irreducibility slightly differs from the classical one, since we are considering our monoid representations to be over $\\mathbb{C}$ instead of $\\mathbb{Q}$; nevertheless, several well-known results remain valid-for instance, the fact that every irreducible automaton is necessarily simple. We provide a complete characterization of simplicity in the circular case by means of the \\emph{weak contracting property}. Furthermore, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for a circular \\emph{contracting automaton} (a stronger condition than the weakly contracting one) to be irreducible, and we present examples illustrating our results."}

The modules of one forms and of braided derivations are modules in a compact closed category of $H$-equivariant $A$-bimodules, whose internal morphisms correspond to tensor fields. Vector fields and forms approaches to curvature and torsion are proven to be equivalent by extending the Cartan calculus to left (right) $A$-module (not necessarily $A$-bimodule) connections. The Cartan structure equations and the Bianchi identities are derived. Existence and uniqueness of the Levi-Civita connection for arbitrary pseudo-Riemannian metrics is proven via a Koszul formula. The general theory includes Drinfeld twists of commutative geometries and also cotriangular Hopf algebras. It is illustrated with the example of the tensor square of Sweedler Hopf algebra which becomes a noncommutative Einstein manifold via a non-central metric."}
